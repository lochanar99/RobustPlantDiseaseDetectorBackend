1. Training.ipynb file contain the training code which i used to train the model first. I used sequential model to train our model using new Plant leaves disease dataset.
2. After training of our model is done I used that trained file in my GUI.
3. Then I used keras model to Predict the results according to our trained model.
4. The trained system can only pridict the diseases of the plant on which it is trained on.


**************************


1. I have an image processing model which detect dieseased plants according to the leaf.
     Trained over many data ( 1gb ), i will provide you the model and the enviorment files.
    The model should be added to my flask back end application as a function.

2. The flask backend application code will also be given to you, the database which is used is mongoDB.

3. Host the flask application on heroku.( or locally ).

4. From mongoDB take images and process through the python image processing model( now in flask app), 
    and give the result in the backend as diseased or not
